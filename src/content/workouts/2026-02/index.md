  ## Program Overview 
  An icy-cool, winter-themed CrossFit-style training cycle focused on torching fat and building a robust engine as you weather February’s chill. Expect spicy, creative conditioning paired with functional compound lifts—each week dials up the intensity with a snowballing mix of strength, muscle endurance, and frosty fun. Engine days feature snowstorm-inspired metcons mixing cardio & bodyweight, while the rest of the split hits all major muscle groups and movement patterns, ensuring optimal fat loss and muscle retention.
