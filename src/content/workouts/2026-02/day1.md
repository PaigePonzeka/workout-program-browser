## Coaching Notes

Choose strict pull-ups over kipping. Rows: squeeze at the top. Aim for quality movement in the metcon, especially as grip fatigue sets in.

### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: Sets/reps as written, 16 min cap
- Week 2: Add set or small band weight, tighter time cap
- Week 3: Increase pull-up challenge or add row weight, remove band if possible
- Week 4: 3x8 rows @ lower load, 30% less volume in metcon
