## Metcon

Chipper (18min cap):
40 goblet squats (50/35 lbs)
30 alternating reverse lunges
20 box jumps (24/20")
40 sit-ups
Scaling: Use lighter KB, lower box, do bodyweight lunges

## Coaching Notes
Keep squat depth consistent—no 'snowdrifts' (shallow reps)! Control step-ups, tap box gently. Catch your breath, then attack your metcon at 80% intensity in week 1.
