## Coaching Notes
Engine day: intensity should feel frosty but not frozen solid—smooth, sustainable. Focus on rhythm over redline. Only advanced athletes should attempt all reps unbroken week 1.
### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: 20min EMOM @ baseline reps
- Week 2: 22min EMOM (add 1-2 reps per station)
- Week 3: 20min EMOM (try unbroken, or increase wall ball to 25 reps)
- Week 4: 18min EMOM (reduce reps or volume to recover)
