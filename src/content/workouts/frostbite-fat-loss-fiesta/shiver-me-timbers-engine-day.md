title: "Shiver Me Timbers (Engine Day)"
dayNumber: 3
---
Wind-chill engine circuit to ramp up fat loss and aerobic fitness, mixing classic snowy bodyweight and monostructural moves for scalable, high-energy fun.
  ## Warm-Up

5 min easy row, bike, or ski
2 rounds:
- 20 jumping jacks
- 10 PVC pass-throughs
- 12 glute bridges

## Metcon

"Avalanche AMRAP" (18 min AMRAP):
- 400m run or 500m row
- 20 box jumps (24/20")
- 20 alternating DB thrusters (35/25#)
- 20 sit-ups

Scaling: Step-ups instead of box jumps; DB push press for thrusters; reduce run/row to 300m

## Cool-Down

- Downward dog: 60 sec
- World's greatest stretch: 60 sec/side
- Kneeling hip flexor stretch: 60 sec/side
- Seated hamstring stretch: 60 sec/side
- Supine spinal twist: 45 sec/side

## Core / Optional Finisher

Optional:
- Tabata (4 min): bicycle crunches

## Coaching Notes

Keep engine metcons at 75-85% max heart rate. Pacing is more important than all-out speed. Focus on smooth, rhythmic breathing.

### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: 18 min AMRAP as written
- Week 2: Try for more rounds, or add 5 reps per movement
- Week 3: Add a 100m run/row each round
- Week 4: 15 min cap, aim for best possible pace—reduce volume for active recovery
