title: "Polar Push Party"
dayNumber: 0
---
A frosty push day firing up the chest, shoulders, and triceps with classic presses and a blizzard-blast finisher. Sets the tone for the program's icy theme and freezes in pressing strength early.
  ## Warm-Up

5 min steady bike or row
2 rounds for quality:
- 10 banded Y-T-Ws
- 10 band pull-aparts
- 10 shoulder tap push-ups
- 15 arm circles each direction

## Strength or Skill

Barbell Bench Press
- 4 sets x 6-8 reps @ RPE 7-7.5
- Rest 2-3 min

Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press
- 3 sets x 10 reps @ RPE 7
- Rest 1-2 min

## Metcon

"Snowball Express" (14 min AMRAP):
- 10 push-ups
- 14 alternating DB snatch (35/25#)
- 40 double-unders (scale: 80 singles)

Scaling: Incline push-ups or from knees; snatch with lighter DB; substitute taps for double-unders

## Cool-Down

- Doorway pec stretch: 60 sec/side
- Overhead triceps stretch: 45 sec/side
- Cross-body shoulder stretch: 45 sec/side
- Prone shoulder opener (arm extended palm-down, rotate torso away): 45 sec/side
- Child's pose: 1 min

## Core / Optional Finisher

2 rounds, not for time:
- 20 plank shoulder taps
- 30 sec hollow body hold

## Coaching Notes

Control every press's descent and keep elbows at 45°. Metcon should keep you moving, not failing—scale so you keep rest minimal.
