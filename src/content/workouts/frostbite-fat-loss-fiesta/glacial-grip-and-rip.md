## Metcon

"Icy Ladder" (for time, cap 16 min):
10-8-6-4-2
- Banded lat pull-downs (kneeling or standing)
- Kettlebell swings (53/35#)

## Coaching Notes

Control each row—squeeze at the top and lower slowly. Aim for quality movement in the metcon, especially as grip fatigue sets in.

### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: Sets/reps as written, 16 min cap
- Week 2: Add set or add weight to DB rows, tighter time cap
- Week 3: Increase DB row weight or add set, go heavier on banded lat pull-downs
- Week 4: 3x10 rows per arm @ lower load, 30% less volume in metcon
