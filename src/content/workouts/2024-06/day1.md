    # Gorilla Grip Gala
    A back and biceps-focused pull day to build a silverback-worthy upper back and bulletproof grip, all with a beastly approach.
    ## Warm-Up
5 min bike (steady)
Then 2 rounds (for quality):
- 10 banded face pulls
- 8 ring/scapular pull-ups
- 12 single-arm DB rows (light)

## Strength or Skill
Barbell Bent-Over Row
- 4 sets x 8 reps @ RPE 7.5
- Rest 2-2.5 min

Pull-Ups (Strict or Banded)
- 4 sets x max reps (stop 1-2 short of failure)
- Rest 90 sec

Alternating DB Hammer Curls
- 3 sets x 12 reps/arm

## Metcon
"King Kong Climb" (Chipper; 18 min Cap):
- 30 alligator push-ups
- 40 alternating dumbbell snatches (light)
- 500m row/bike/800m run
- 40 hanging knee raises
- 30 inverted rows (bar or rings)
Scaling: Knee push-ups, lighter DB, hanging knee raises to lying leg raises

## Cool-Down
- Lat wall stretch: 45 sec/side
- Wrist flexor stretch: 30 sec/side
- Cat-cow stretch: 60 sec

## Core / Optional Finisher
3 sets:
- 12 ab wheel rollouts (or plank walkouts)
- 20 farmer hold march steps

## Coaching Notes
Use controlled motion on rows and pulls, squeeze at peak contraction. Select scales that allow unbroken sets. Focus on grip even during core work.
### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: Set base weights/reps. Chipper as prescribed.
- Week 2: +1 row set or +5-10 lbs, try to complete the chipper faster or with fewer breaks.
- Week 3: Row sets 5x6, add DB weight, more reps per pull-up set.
- Week 4: Drop loading ~10%, reduce chipper volume by 20% (if needed).
