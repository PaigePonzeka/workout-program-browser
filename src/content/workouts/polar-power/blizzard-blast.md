title: "Blizzard Blast"
dayNumber: 3
---
Arctic engine day! A blizzard of monostructural, bodyweight, and light DB/KB work to torch calories and sharpen conditioning. The chillest way to heat up your metabolism.
## Warm-Up

5 min easy row or jog
Then 2 rounds:
- 15 jumping jacks
- 10 air squats
- 10 shoulder circles
- 10 lunges

## Metcon

20 min EMOM:
- Minute 1: 15/12 calorie bike or 250m row
- Minute 2: 15 kettlebell swings (moderate, not maximal)
- Minute 3: 12 box jumps or box step-ups (as preferred)
- Minute 4: 10 DB/KB thrusters (light-moderate)
- Minute 5: Rest

Rotate through for 4 full rounds.

Scaling: Reduce reps/weight, perform step-ups or air squats
Harder: Add 2 reps per movement, decrease rest (less than minute 5)

## Cool-Down

- Standing quad stretch, 45 sec/side
- Figure-4 glute stretch, 45 sec/side
- Supine breathing, 2 min

## Core / Optional Finisher

Optional: 2x
- 30 mountain climbers
- 30 sec plank hold

## Coaching Notes
Pace early rounds to avoid burnout in later EMOM cycles. Quality reps more important than max speed.
### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: Baseline reps, 20 min EMOM
- Week 2: Add 1-2 reps; increase total calories per round
- Week 3: Shorten rest or challenge pace
- Week 4: Keep reps, decrease total time to 16 min (deload)
