title: "Polar Express"
dayNumber: 4
---
Rotating full body day with compound moves and frosty circuit fun—balances weekly training with all-around strength, power, and a Siberian-storm sprint finisher.
## Warm-Up

5 min inclined walk
Then, 2 rounds:
- 10 alternating spiderman lunge
- 10 scapular wall slides
- 12 kettlebell deadlifts

## Strength or Skill

Dumbbell Clean & Push Press (each arm)
- 4x8 (moderate load, alternate arms)
Alternating Reverse Lunge (DB/KB or bodyweight)
- 3x12/side
Renegade Row (light DB)
- 3x10/side

## Metcon

10 min AMRAP:
- 10 DB snatches (as heavy as good form allows, alt arms)
- 12 box step-overs
- 14 mountain climbers
- 20 med ball slams or substitute 10 broad jumps

Scaling: Lighter DB/KB, air squats instead step-overs, reduce intensity or reps.
Harder: Heavier weights, faster transitions, double DB snatch.

## Cool-Down

- Lizard stretch, 45 sec/side
- Chest stretch on wall, 60 sec/side
- Seated forward fold, 60 sec

## Core / Optional Finisher

Tabata: 20s on/10s off, 4 rounds each
- Flutter kicks
- Hollow rocks

## Coaching Notes
Push explosiveness with dumbbells but stay in control. For AMRAP, prioritize transitions.
### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: Baseline loads/reps
- Week 2: +5% weight, aim for +1 round on AMRAP
- Week 3: 5x6 for strength, heavier DB snatch in Metcon
- Week 4: Lower volume, maintain intensity
