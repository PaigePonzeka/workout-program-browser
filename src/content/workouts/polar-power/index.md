  ## Program Overview 
  Polar Power is a 4-week arctic-themed program fusing full-body strength with chilly, calorie-melting conditioning circuits. Each session explores a different wintry wilderness—balancing push, pull, legs, and engine efforts while progressing strength and endurance for fat loss. You'll stay frosty with heart-pumping intervals, adventurous combinations, and progressive overload, all while keeping muscle and motivation on ice.
