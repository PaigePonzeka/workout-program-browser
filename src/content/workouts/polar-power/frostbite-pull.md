title: "Frostbite Pull"
dayNumber: 1
---
A controlled blizzard of pulling for the back and biceps—layering strength sets with movement variety and grip work. Builds the back to weather any arctic storm.
## Warm-Up

5 min row
Then, 2 rounds:
- 15 banded straight-arm pull-downs
- 10 banded face pulls
- 20 jumping jacks

## Strength or Skill

Lat Pulldown (wide, moderate)
- 4x8
Barbell Bent-over Row
- 4x8 @ RPE 7
Alternating Dumbbell Hammer Curl
- 3x12

## Metcon

14 min AMRAP:
- 10 Inverted Barbell Rows (rack set low; scale to feet flat/closer to vertical)
- 12 Kettlebell Swings (focus hip power)
- 16 Russian Twists (bodyweight or with light DB)
- 100m Ski Erg or 150m Row, sub 20 cal bike

Scaling: Band-assisted rows, lighter KB, reduce row distance.
Harder: Feet elevated rows, heavier KB, strict tempo.

## Cool-Down

- Thread-the-needle stretch, 45 sec/side
- Banded overhead lat stretch, 60 sec/side
- Seated forward fold, 90 sec

## Core / Optional Finisher

Accumulate 45-60 sec dead hang from pull-up bar (several sets as needed)

## Coaching Notes
Hold a pause at contraction on all pulling movements. Challenge grip in Metcon but maintain pace.
### Week-over-Week Progression
