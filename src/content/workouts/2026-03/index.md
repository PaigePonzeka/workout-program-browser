## Program Overview

Welcome to the **March 2026 Strength Foundation** block. After last month's hypertrophy focus, we're shifting to heavier loads, lower rep ranges, and longer rest periods to build maximal strength.

## Training Split

| Day | Focus | Intensity |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Day 1 | Upper Body Strength | High |
| Day 2 | Lower Body Strength | High |
| Day 3 | Full Body Power | Moderate–High |

## Key Principles

- **Heavy Loads**: Working in the 3–6 rep range for main lifts
- **Long Rest**: 3–5 minutes between heavy compound sets
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Fewer sets, but every rep counts
- **RPE Target**: Main lifts at RPE 8–9 (1–2 reps in reserve)

## Nutrition Notes

Maintain caloric intake at or slightly above maintenance. Prioritize carbohydrates around training sessions for energy. Keep protein at 0.8–1g per pound of body weight.
