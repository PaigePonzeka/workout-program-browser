A full-body Friday romp! Hit head-to-tail with dynamic free-weight movements, without overly roasting the legs.

5 min light row or bike
Then "Animal Flow" (for quality):
- 10 bear crawls forward/back

14 min EMOM:
- Minute 1: 12 DB hang cleans (25/35 lbs)
- Minute 2: 16 alternating mountain climbers
- Minute 3: 10 banded lat pull-downs (standing)
- Minute 4: Rest

Scaling:
- Use lighter DBs, reduce reps, slow down tempo

- Thread the needle: 1 min/side

## Core / Optional Finisher

## Coaching Notes

Stay focused on quality movement. Limit lower-body fatigue to recover for next week.

### Week-over-Week Progression
- Week 1: 3x10 pressing, 14 min EMOM
- Week 2: 4x8 pressing (slightly heavier), add 2 reps to EMOM movements
- Week 3: Increase load or tempo, keep time the same
- Week 4: 3x8 pressing, 10 min EMOM (deload, crisp reps)
